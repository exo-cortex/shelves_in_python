#shelf design in python

This project is my attempt of designing a big shelf that fits all the stuff lying around without a fixed place. 
By defining the parameters wood thickness, width, height, depth, number of compartments (vertical and horizontal) it shall ouput all needed parts plus prices.
Ideally it shall also output a 3D render of the finished object.
